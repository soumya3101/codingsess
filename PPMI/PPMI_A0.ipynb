    "# PPMI Gait Analysis\n",
    "This data set is part of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Anat Mirelman, PhD, of Tel Aviv University is the PI. According to the study summary: \"The Gait study was proposed in order to obtain quantitative, objective motor measures that could inform on pre-clinical symptoms, progression markers, and dynamic changes of function throughout disease and potential modifiers and mediators of motor symptoms.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to examine the data and later implement some ML algorithms to try and classify PD patients from non-PD patients based on the gait measures.\n",

    "The reason why we have to read in both csv files is because the gait csv does not contain all of the necessary information we want about the subjects. For instance, we don't know from the gait data what diagnosis each individual has received. This is a problem if we later want to classify PD vs non-PD. The diagnosis information is contained within the screening csv. The trick is that there are a lot of subjects in the screening csv that were not part of the gait study. ***What to do?***\n",
